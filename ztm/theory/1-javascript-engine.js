// Javascript Engine
// JS Engine is the core of JavaScript to execute javascript code in Computer. This understands the js code and convert it into machine-readable code
// There are lots of JS engine developed by different org. One of the most popular JavaScript engines is v8 Engine which is developed by Google written in c++


// What's Inside JavaScript engine or Step to Js file to machine-readable code
// 1> hello.js
// 2> Parse (Lexical Analysis) --- Breaks the code
// 3> AST ( Abstract Syntax Tree )
// 4> Interpreter (Covert to byte code)
// 5> Profiler (Looking for optimize the code)
// 6> Compiler (JIT compiler) - ex: in google its called "turbofan"
// 7> Optimized Code
// 8> Binary Code

// Another more important part of engine is memory management
// 1> Call Stack
// 2> Memory Heap

// JIT COMPILER
// Just in Time Compiler is a compiler that compiles code on the fly as it runs combined with (interpreter and compiler)

// Byte Code
//  is a machine-readable form of JavaScript code that is used by the JavaScript engine to execute the code.
